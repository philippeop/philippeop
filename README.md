Experience with [Angular](https://github.com/angular), [React](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org), [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node), full stack [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) (4.6.x these days, unfortunately).

In my opinion:
* jQuery = barebones interactions, i.e internal site. Or personal scripting in [Violentmonkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey)@violentmonkey.
* React = portfolio page with media and a "contact me" feature. 
* Angular = web application, i.e a store or high-feature website.

jQuery != framework.
React = framework.
Angular = framework. (React=Angular)

Angular > React for a web application
I prefer Angular. By experience, site = web application ([rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) is neat).

Words: React is more "heres how to do a site", Angular is more "heres a framework".
